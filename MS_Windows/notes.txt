I've had "LGTV Companion" fail while I was developing this - a window titled "Error" with the cryptic message "Failed to connect to the named pipe. Service may be stopped" was displayed. (The problem may have been triggered by an invalid command line argument.) LGTV Companion worked again after restarting my computer; I also managed to fix the problem by opening services.msc (by typing Win-R and entering "services.msc"), finding "LGTV Companion Service" and clicking "Start Service".
